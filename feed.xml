MRCC Chile, MRCC Falmouth, the Golden Globe Race organisers, and especially the master and crew on Tian Fu, have given it their all over the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was with a heavy heart Susie left DHL Starlight to fend for herself, before she fills with water and rests on the Pacific Ocean floor. DHL Starlight has been her home for the past few years; a faithful friend who stood up valiantly to all the elements, a guardian until their last moments together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once aboard Tian Fu, Susie remarked how enormously welcome the crew made her feel. They offered lots of food and drink, and over the next week or so she’ll have plenty of time to rest en route to Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she was younger, Susie loved doing somersaults on trampolines. We just never thought she’d do one in a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

The safety of Susie is of utmost importance. From the information we have available at this time we know that Susie was sailing in the Pacific Ocean, 2,000 miles west of Cape Horn in 60 knot winds when her wind vane broke. The exact height of the waves is unknown, but massive seas reported. She deployed her drogue to steady the boat, but that failed. She was in the cabin when the boat pitchpoled, sending her and the boat’s contents flying forward and knocking her unconscious for a period of time. She sustained a minor head injury and spent the following hours removing the rigging debris to prevent further boat damage. The hull of the boat is unbreached, and Susie is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chilean authorities are coordinating a rescue effort, and have requested assistance from a ship 480 miles South West of Susie’s position. Her captain expects to take 2 days to reach the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until today, Susie was attempting to sail around the world solo as part of the Golden Globe Race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susie Goodall Racing would like to thank the race support team for their help during this time. The family are in regular contact with the Golden Globe Race team and have spoken to Susie since the incident. Further information will be released when available on the &lt;a class=&quot;orange&quot; href=&quot;https://goldengloberace.com&quot;&gt;GGR website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We are extremely saddened by the incident which took place on December 5th on board Susie Goodall’s boat DHL Starlight.

I can’t wait to see it. 3 1/2 months since I last saw land, that was the Cape Verdes and even then I didn’t get a good look as it was hazy so I could only see the outline and no detail. I have no doubt that it’ll be incredibly tempting to stop when I get to Hobart, but at least when I leave I’ll be on my way home. Plus, I’m really looking forward to the Pacific; I just hope it’s a nicer ocean to cross than the Indian has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last four months have had a bit of everything. From the Canaries to the Equator, it was super downwind sailing, with only a few calms as we passed the doldrums. I was always nervous that I would get stuck in a windless hole for weeks, but the northeasterly trades turned to the southeast trades with barely a break. From there it was the long beat south. I had been debating whether to go the traditional route and go to the west with the wind more abeam or go east and be hard on the wind which is a shorter route. The St Helena high was far from stationary so I ended up meandering down the middle and not committing to either route. It would have been fine but at the end of the trades I got some south-easterlies and made a huge mistake and went east on them instead of continuing south to 40º. Because I did that I got stuck in the variables for weeks. It was just calm after calm. Easily the most frustrating time so far. A glassy sea, not a ripple of wind day after day. I was tearing my hair out, kicking myself for not having gone south. It was such a relief to finally get to 40 degrees south and past the Cape of Good Hope. To begin with the Indian Ocean gave more easterlies and calm days than westerlies. To look at the chart every day and barely move my fix, was hard work. Not even a third of the way round the world and progress was painfully slow. Half way to Australia though it got better, but the weather is so unstable in the Indian Ocean. It can change with no warning. One day I was sailing along quite happily with 15 knots from the north; luckily I was on deck because in the blink of an eye I had 40 knots from the southwest. I had full sails up so the boat was flattened. At first I just stared at the mainsail in the water waiting for my brain to catch up with the new wind. Then I couldn’t decide whether I should drop the headsail or main first so everything came down at once. I’ve had a few of these sudden wind shifts, they are still unpredictable but my brain now works straight away instead of lagging behind. Most common though is a calm of a couple of hours between a wind shift, much more civilised I think. It makes flying the kite a little harder I find. In the Atlantic I would quite happily leave the kite up overnight but here if I have a kite up then it’s a sleepless night. I have still been caught out and had to wrestle to get the bugger down. It would be so much better to have a sock to hoist and drop, easier anyway, but race rules sadly don’t allow. Hoisting is fine because the kite is just wooled (short pieces of wool which hold it together while being hoisted) but dropping it is interesting on my own, especially because I tend to leave the kite up for a little too long as I don’t like the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a sailing point of view, the Atlantic was easy in the trades. I would have the same sails for days or weeks and only trim them, but in the Southern Ocean I can go from full sails with kite to the storm jib and deep-reefed main in the space of hours and back again. There’s more to do in the South which is great but I do miss the warmth of the trade winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the South Atlantic, albatrosses have been almost daily visitors. I was mighty excited seeing the first one as I’d never seen one before. Shearwaters, petrels and albatrosses are always here unless there’s a calm, then I don’t see them. I love having their company, but they keep trying to take my fishing hook so I’ve had to pull it close to the boat. It’s probably the reason I’m not catching anything here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to getting under Cape Leeuwin, to me it was a big milestone. For 3 days leading up to it I’d had a lot of wind so was doing some good consistent speeds. The night I rounded it, I opened a bottle of wine I’d been given to mark the occasion. I only had a tiny bit as I don’t really drink much at sea. Next milestone: Hobart, I thought. Only a few hours later I got a text from the race saying to head north to avoid a storm ahead. I had a NNE wind and a 4-5 metre sea so my northing was minimal. The storm was forming ahead of me, to the northeast. It wasn’t your typical Southern Ocean storm, it was small and incredibly vicious. Having no modern forecasting technology onboard I would not have known about it until I was in it as it developed incredibly quickly. It was suggested that I sail west away from the centre so I didn’t end up in the middle of the storm. I took the advice and sailed west back along my track. Losing all those precious miles for 12 hours. But to not be in the centre of a 70+ knot storm it was all I could do, but not so easy to be sailing backwards that’s for sure. If I had been sailing the right direction it would have been a great sail but I was totally lost as to what to do. I kept getting really confused with the north now being to the right as opposed to the left and the sun being on the wrong side, it just felt so wrong. When the NNE wind died and the calm before the storm came there was nothing I could do but wait. Everything was stowed and lashed down so we just rolled in the swell watching the sky. An eerie feeling. It’s horrible waiting for a storm that you know is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By going west I avoided being in the worst of it for 6-8 hours; instead I got 2-3 hours of the height of it. In total, it lasted for 14-16 hours, with 70+ knots and 12-13 metre seas. I don’t really want to write about that storm right now; some stage I will but for 10-11 hours I was at the helm - because a tube on my self-steering had snapped - a decision that still really bothers me. I collapsed in my bunk when it had calmed to 40-45 knots and thought … &lt;em&gt;“What am I doing here!?”&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days following the storm were the hardest of the whole voyage. The sea was still large at 7-9 metres and the wind between 30 and 40 knots. Swell was coming from every direction so it was the most confused I had ever seen the sea. It meant that the boat could not be stern-to every wave so we were constantly beam-on to the swell and with the wind vane playing up not being able to properly fix it in that size sea we just got knocked down constantly. To say I’d had enough by this point is an understatement. They were the hardest and loneliest days I’ve ever had. All I wanted was a break from it. But being under Australia, half the world from home I might as well sail home again instead of taking a break. So in 4-5 months’ time, that’s where I’ll be, home. And hopefully the toughest times of the trip are left behind, between the South Atlantic variables and Australia. I would have written more about the voyage to date but my lovely brother Nick will be typing up my scribbled handwritten blog so I will save the rest of the stories for when I’m back at a computer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In a few days I will see land again.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DHL Express, Susie’s Founding and Official Logistics Partner, will continue to provide support on her journey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DHL Express CEO Ken Allen: “The qualities she’ll need to take on this incredible challenge mirror the values we all share at DHL Express.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of preparation, Susie Goodall will soon embark on her non-stop solo voyage around the world as the final countdown to the Golden Globe Race 2018 is on. She is the only female and the youngest competitor amongst 19 sailors attempting to complete the journey without any outside assistance or modern equipment, recreating the conditions of the original race won by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston in 1969. DHL Express has been proud to provide logistics support for Susie throughout her preparations, including rebuilding the engine and bringing items such as solar panels and watertight doors from around the world to refurbish the vessel. They even launched a competition to choose a new name for the boat – now called DHL Starlight – that will be her home for the best part of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great feeling to have helped deliver Susie to the start line. We’ll all watch on with an immense amount of pride when she sets sail on July 1st. But the fact that she’ll complete the race around the time of our 50th anniversary makes it even more special for everyone at DHL,” said Ken Allen, CEO, DHL Express. “This has been her dream from a young age and her determination and perseverance to make it a reality are truly inspiring. The qualities she’ll need to take on this incredible challenge mirror the values we all share at DHL Express. She’ll need speed to win the race. She’ll need a can-do spirit in the face of adversity. She’ll need to get things right first time. And she’ll need passion to keep going when the chips are down. She may be sailing on her own, but 100,000 DHL Express employees in over 220 countries and territories worldwide are behind her all the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the race is underway, DHL’s support will continue for example through the DHL radio network. From stations in multiple continents, DHL will contact Susie by SSB radio to keep her updated with world events, as well as exchanging messages between her and her family and friends.
“In some ways, it’s a relief to be finally starting the race,” said Susie. “It’s taken a lot of hard work and preparation just to reach this position, and I could not have done it without the support of DHL. 300 days is a long time to be alone, however knowing that DHL’s 100,000 employees are supporting me is a massive help, making me feel connected to the rest of the world even in the middle of the ocean. It’s something only a company with truly global reach can achieve.”
Susie and her fellow competitors set sail from Les Sables d’Olonne, France on July 1st. Their 48,000 km voyage will traverse the three Great Capes before returning to Les Sables d’Olonne in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

A particular issue is going to be how to stay hydrated. Under the rules of the race, I can’t have a water maker on the boat, and I can only carry enough water for about half the time I’m away. I’ve partly solved this by taking tinned food, but most of my meals are freeze dried and I will need to collect rainwater as I go. To do this, I can attach my hoses to a drain on my sprayhood which will then fill my water tanks - and buckets to collect water as it drains off the sail work quite well. I must be one of the only people hoping for regular rain clouds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a great fan of kefir, and have been making my own long before I planned this trip. One of my pleasures will be making this daily, using the grains given to me by my mother, with UHT milk to feed it. For those of you who don’t know, kefir is similar to yoghurt, and contains all sorts of vitamins and minerals as well as a healthy dose of bacteria. I won’t be able to get fresh food once my initial supplies run out, so it’s going to be really important to find a way of keeping healthy as I go. I’m also taking a sourdough starter so I can make bread - my brother and I are going to get this underway at the weekend so it’s ready and tested by the time I leave. Having these two resources with me will be great, and will remind me every day that my family are supporting me all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparations on the boat are coming along. This week I went round to Hamble to have the back stay fitted with some insulators which will turn it into my HF antenna. Coming back, I spent 6 hours on deck enjoying the beautiful sunny weather, and foolishly got extremely sunburnt so I was very grateful for the Weleda skin food afterwards. Despite people commenting on my windburned face when I returned, I plastered on the skin food and it took all the heat out. I also, foolishly, lifted a lot of heavy gear, and I’m now using the arnica oil to great effect. There are definitely going to be times during the nine months of the race that I will be bruised and battered, having Weleda products with me will make a great difference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training in the lead up to the start has been quite demanding at times. On top of all the work needed to get the boat to the start line which hasn’t always been the easiest. Only 2 and a half weeks to have everything completed before I set off for Plymouth to have a final rig tune up and then to Falmouth for the Parade of Sail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to the start, but the things I will miss are beginning to take on great importance as well: not just family and friends, but simple pleasures such as my daily walk around the lakes here in the morning, bike rides and yoga on a platform that doesn’t move. And all the fresh food that I won’t have for 9 months. Despite this, I can’t wait to get going - only 6 more weeks to the start…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As the start date approaches the challenges of the race are becoming more apparent.
